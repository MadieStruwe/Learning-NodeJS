# Learning-NodeJS
Personal repo for my files to learn NodeJs

My files for a tutorial I am following to learn NodeJS. The turotial can be found at https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/

I followed these instructions to install NodeJS on my machine https://websiteforstudents.com/install-the-latest-node-js-and-nmp-packages-on-ubuntu-16-04-18-04-lts/

This is my GitHub that contains school work and projects I have or am working on. My intention of creating this account is so I can show employers work I have done and how I have progressed as a programmer. Please do not copy any code, files, or parts there of. I do not give concent for people to not use my work unless either I have given concent or the code in here is already open source and free to use. Do NOT remove the credits of open source code or citations.
